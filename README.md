little gist of the game

Issues i faced was italic some text even when i tried to import the font. another that was hard was sorting the characters so that you can see who is tanks, duelist etc.. so that created some issues, figured out to make their own containers. Overall this was a fun assingment to make, i decided to make it about marvel rivals because its a very fun game and if you havent already should play it!! If i had more time i would like to have been able to click on the characters and give back stories on them. i would have liked to added videos or have a link that send you to a video to watch some clips of Marvel Rivals.

The logo is also a go back to home page when you click on "Marvel Rivals"
The characters pop a bit when you hover over them
I didnt add to much to the home or about page just mainly the character page i wish i had more time to added more on it.

what i wish to learn in future class is to more advance animation and transitions.
